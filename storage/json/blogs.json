			"text" : "The paper investigates the accuracy and computational efficiency of various thermal modeling approaches for bond-wires in wire bonded packages. It recommends an improved thermal modeling technique for thermal designers that can be implemented in their work. The significance of the thermal impact of bond-wires in IC packages is also demonstrated",
